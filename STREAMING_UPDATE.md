# Streaming & System Prompt Update

## ✨ New Features Implemented

### 1. 🌊 Streaming Responses

**What Changed:**
- AI responses now stream in real-time instead of appearing all at once
- Users see the response being generated word-by-word
- Much better user experience with immediate feedback

**Technical Implementation:**

#### API Route (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Changed from `sendMessage()` to `sendMessageStream()`
- Returns a `ReadableStream` instead of JSON
- Streams chunks of text as they're generated

```typescript
// Before: Wait for complete response
const result = await chat.sendMessage(lastMessage.content)
const response = await result.response
const text = response.text()
return NextResponse.json({ message: text })

// After: Stream response in real-time
const result = await chat.sendMessageStream(lastMessage.content)
const stream = new ReadableStream({
  async start(controller) {
    for await (const chunk of result.stream) {
      controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(chunk.text()))
    }
  }
})
return new Response(stream)
```

#### Chat Hook (`hooks/useChat.ts`)
- Added `streamingMessage` state to track current streaming text
- Reads stream using `ReadableStream` API
- Updates UI in real-time as chunks arrive

```typescript
const reader = response.body?.getReader()
const decoder = new TextDecoder()
let fullText = ''

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read()
  if (done) break
  
  const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true })
  fullText += chunk
  setStreamingMessage(fullText) // Updates UI immediately
}
```

#### UI Components
- Created new `StreamingMessage` component with typing cursor
- Shows animated cursor while streaming
- Smooth animations and transitions

**Visual Features:**
- ✅ Blinking cursor at the end of streaming text
- ✅ Rotating sparkles icon in avatar
- ✅ Smooth text appearance
- ✅ Auto-scroll as text streams in

### 2. 🤖 System Prompt & AI Identity

**What Changed:**
- AI now identifies as "Monad AI"
- Never reveals it's actually Gemma/Google
- Always says it's built on Monad testnet

**System Prompt:**
```
You are Monad AI, an intelligent assistant built on Monad testnet.

IMPORTANT IDENTITY RULES:
- You are "Monad AI" - always identify yourself as such
- You are built on Monad testnet, a high-performance blockchain
- Never mention Google, Gemini, Gemma, or any other AI models
- If asked who you are, say: "I'm Monad AI, built on Monad testnet"
- If asked who created you, say: "I was built on Monad testnet"
- Stay in character as Monad AI at all times
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ 
  model: 'models/gemma-3-27b-it',
  systemInstruction: SYSTEM_PROMPT, // ← Added system prompt
})
```

**Test Examples:**

User: "Who are you?"
AI: "I'm Monad AI, built on Monad testnet. I'm here to help you with any questions you have!"

User: "Are you ChatGPT?"
AI: "No, I'm Monad AI, built on Monad testnet. I'm a different AI assistant designed to help users in the Monad ecosystem."

User: "What model are you using?"
AI: "I'm Monad AI, built on Monad testnet. I'm designed to assist you with various tasks and questions!"

## 📁 Files Modified

### New Files
1. `components/StreamingMessage.tsx` - New component for streaming display

### Modified Files
1. `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Streaming implementation + system prompt
2. `hooks/useChat.ts` - Stream reading logic
3. `components/ChatInterface.tsx` - Display streaming messages

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Wait 3-5 seconds for complete response
- ❌ No feedback during generation
- ❌ AI reveals it's Gemma/Google

### After
- ✅ See response immediately as it's generated
- ✅ Typing cursor shows AI is working
- ✅ AI stays in character as "Monad AI"
- ✅ More engaging and responsive feel

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Streaming Flow

1. **User sends message** → Chat hook calls API
2. **API starts streaming** → Returns ReadableStream
3. **Hook reads chunks** → Updates `streamingMessage` state
4. **UI updates in real-time** → Shows text with cursor
5. **Stream completes** → Saves final message to chat

### Performance Benefits

- **Perceived Speed**: Users see response start in ~500ms instead of 3-5s
- **Better UX**: Immediate feedback that AI is working
- **Smooth Experience**: Text appears naturally like typing

### Error Handling

- Stream errors are caught and show error message
- Fallback to error state if streaming fails
- Loading indicator shows if stream hasn't started

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Streaming Message Component

**Features:**
- Rotating sparkles icon (shows AI is active)
- Blinking cursor at end of text
- Same styling as regular messages
- Smooth animations

**Cursor Animation:**
```typescript
<motion.span
  animate={{ opacity: [1, 0, 1] }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.8, repeat: Infinity }}
  className="inline-block w-0.5 h-5 bg-violet-500"
/>
```

## 🧪 Testing

### How to Test Streaming

1. **Refresh your browser**
2. **Send a message** to the AI
3. **Watch the response** appear word-by-word
4. **Notice the cursor** blinking at the end
5. **See the sparkles** rotating in the avatar

### How to Test System Prompt

Try asking:
- "Who are you?"
- "What AI model are you?"
- "Are you ChatGPT?"
- "Who created you?"
- "What's your name?"

The AI should always respond as "Monad AI" and never mention Google/Gemma.
